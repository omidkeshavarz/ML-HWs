    "\n",
    "Scale Independence: Features often have different scales. For example, one feature might range from 0 to 1, while another might range from 0 to 1000. If we don't normalize these features, the model might give undue importance to features with larger scales, leading to suboptimal performance.\n",
    "Faster Convergence: Normalizing data can help algorithms converge more quickly during training. Many optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent, work more efficiently when features are on similar scales. Normalizing the data can help prevent oscillation and slow convergence.\n",
    "Improved Numerical Stability: Normalizing data can improve the numerical stability of the optimization process. Large input values can lead to large intermediate values in computations, which may cause numerical overflow or underflow issues. Normalizing data to a similar scale helps mitigate these problems.\n",
    "Regularization: Some regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, assume that features are on similar scales. Normalizing the data ensures that regularization penalties are applied fairly across all features."
